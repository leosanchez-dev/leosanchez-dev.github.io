PART 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW

1. Project Title: Leorenz Tech Portfolio

2. Project Theme: Portfolio Website

3. Personal Connection: Living in Hawaii taught me the value of community and resourcefulness, which I can bring the
work and this site project inspires me of how far I've learn, developing technical skills, and problem solving abilities
based on my journey to pursue onto the creativity with technology.

PART 2: AUDIENCE & PURPOSE

4. Target Audience: My target audience included instructors evaluating my coursework and potential employers who wants
to see on my technical skills. I designed the site to be clean, organized, and professional so it works for both
academic review and real-world job opportunities out there.


5. Site Purpose: The purpose of this website is to document and show that my progress as I learn HTML, CSS, and web
design can be related to any IT careers or jobs out there. As I would think as of space to display my work, reflect on
my growth, and practice building real-world web pages.
