    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Leorenz Lygan Sanchez, and this site showcases my journey in web development
        through ICS 107. Living in Hawaii taught me the value of community and resourcefulness—qualities I bring into my
        work as I grow my technical and creative skills. I built this site to show what I’ve learned, not just tell it.
        Every section reflects how I approach problems: with clarity, structure, and purpose.
        If you're here to see what I can do, I made sure it's all real and hands-on.

    <p>This site is designed for instructors reviewing my coursework and potential employers interested in my skills.
        It's clean, organized, and professional to serve both academic and career goals.
        I built everything myself to show what I can actually do, not just talk about it.
        It reflects how I think — clear, efficient, and focused on results.
        If you're here to evaluate me, I made sure there's nothing confusing or cluttered to get in the way. </p>
